- Target: £50k+ this year
- Earnings crons set (VRT, CVX, MU, TSLA, INTC, PLTR)

## Lessons (Hard-Won)
- ALWAYS use Netbird IPs, never LAN (migrated from Tailscale Feb 15, 2026)
- 8B models too weak for OpenClaw agent — use 2.5 Flash / Sonnet minimum
- Write memory immediately — "mental notes" don't survive sessions
- Custom Ollama providers need "apiKey": "ollama" dummy value
- Mac Mini paths: export PATH when SSHing
- Two independent configs (MacBook Air + Mac Mini) — don't confuse them
- ALWAYS grep .env files + secrets/.credentials before claiming something is missing — Matt has given creds multiple times
- Use X API (bearer token), don't scrape x.com
- **CRITICAL: Service reliability is core competency** — Working solutions must not rot (Feb 13, 2026)
- **State maintenance failure pattern** — Matt's feedback: "You simply cannot maintain state" and "It's poor and won't scale" (Root Cause: OpenClaw running on Mac Mini but believed it was on MacBook Air, attempting to SSH to itself, Feb 15, 2026)
- OpenClaw services crash frequently on Mac Mini — investigate LaunchDaemon setup for auto-restart
- USPTO API changed from api.patentsview.org to search.patentsview.org — only supports exact equality matches
- **Netbird Migration Complete (Feb 15, 2026)** — Migrated entire infrastructure from broken Tailscale to reliable Netbird P2P mesh. All SSH and workspace sync now via Netbird IPs only.
- **Final Netbird IPs**: MacBook Air 100.87.78.214, Mac Mini 100.87.48.20, Y2K 100.87.231.197, Jetson Orin 100.87.171.38
- **Infrastructure lesson**: Replace unreliable systems entirely rather than fighting with them; when infrastructure changes, ALL references must be updated immediately (Feb 15, 2026)
- **AlphaEnergy cron job model errors** — Fixed broken "google/gemini-2.5-flash" model references in isolated session jobs
- Direct IP addressing is more reliable than hostname resolution (Feb 15, 2026)
- Heartbeat timestamp management requires careful epoch time calculations (Feb 15, 2026)
- **Security audit revealed critical vulnerabilities (Mac Mini firewall, prompt injection risk, infrastructure connectivity) requiring immediate remediation (Feb 16, 2026)**
- Need to prioritize firewall configuration and sandboxing for production security.
- Infrastructure monitoring reveals connectivity issues requiring investigation.
- Energy intelligence pipeline resilient despite individual API failures.
- **CRITICAL: Active brute force attack detected and RESOLVED (Feb 19, 2026)** — Kali Y2K Hydra attack terminated at 18:20 GMT. No passwords cracked. Attack ran 15+ days unsuccessfully.

- **Mac Mini cannot SSH to its own Netbird IP (100.87.48.20) - network/firewall issue.** (Feb 17, 2026)
- Ansible `roles_path` fixed by adding `ansible/ansible.cfg` (Feb 17, 2026), but deployment is blocked by Mac Mini's self-SSH connectivity issue.
- **Repeated Ansible failures (15 total so far) due to Mac Mini self-SSH issue highlight a critical infrastructure instability. (Feb 17, 2026)**
- **Security Posture Compromised**: Firewall disabled and 75% of infrastructure nodes offline creates a significant security exposure. (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Criticality of Infrastructure Connectivity**: Loss of remote nodes (MacBook Air, Kali Y2K, Jetson Orin) severely limits distributed monitoring and capabilities. (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Self-SSH issue on Mac Mini** directly blocks automated deployments and self-management, requiring urgent resolution. (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Security incident response successful (Feb 19, 2026)** — Automated security monitoring detected 15-day brute force attack, immediate termination prevented compromise. No credentials breached.

## Next Priorities  
1. ✅ **COMPLETED: STOP BRUTE FORCE ATTACK** - Terminated all Hydra processes on Kali Y2K (Feb 19 18:20 GMT)
2. **CRITICAL: Investigate Y2K compromise** - Determine how unauthorized attack tools were deployed
3. **CRITICAL: Audit credentials** - Verify no systems compromised (attack was unsuccessful - no cracked passwords)
4. **CRITICAL: Restore offline nodes** - MacBook Air (100.87.78.214) & Jetson Orin (100.87.171.38) unreachable
5. **CRITICAL: Enable Mac Mini firewall** - Verify and configure firewall settings
6. **CRITICAL: Investigate Mac Mini's self-SSH issue (100.87.48.20)** - This blocks Ansible deployments
7. Configure authentication rate limiting for OpenClaw Gateway
8. Schedule OpenClaw security update (npm 2026.2.15)
9. Complete SSH key setup — Fix authentication for workspace sync via Netbird
10. Complete Lens API integration — Test and debug Lens collector hanging issues
11. Get Substack cookies → test auto-publisher
12. Build Polymarket bot (needs wallet from Matt)
