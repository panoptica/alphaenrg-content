# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## Active Projects

### Energy Intelligence Agent (Started 2026-02-04)
Automated intelligence system for energy/cooling/quantum investment signals.
- Spec: `specs/energy-intelligence-agent-spec.md`
- Code: `energy-agent/`
- Target: 2-3 actionable trades/month, 12-18 month horizon
- **Status**: MVP working! Daily 7am digests to oc@cloudmonkey.io
- Collectors: ArXiv ✅, SEC ✅, USPTO ⏳ (waiting API key)
- See daily notes for progress

### Hardware Empire (Started 2026-02-04)
Distributed compute for intelligence operations.
- **Mac Mini M4** (192.168.154.44): Local LLM (Llama 3 8B downloading)
- **Jetson Orin**: Satellite imagery CV (pending setup)
- **Kali box**: Scrapers/social monitoring (pending setup)

## Matt's Preferences
- Prefers files over chat pastes for specs
- Wants to watch and learn (not hands-on coding)
- Impatient — get to the point, show progress
- Excited about hardware/empire building

## Lessons Learned
- **2026-02-04**: Lost entire conversation context because I didn't write memory files. Never again. Write it down immediately.
- **2026-02-04**: PatentsView old API deprecated May 2025 - need new API key for USPTO
