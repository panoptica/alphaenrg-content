Energy & Cooling Intelligence Agent - Technical Specification Document
Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-04
Status: Build-Ready Specification

1. Executive Summary
1.1 Purpose
Automated intelligence system monitoring energy generation, cooling technologies, and quantum computing infrastructure to identify investment opportunities 12-18 months before market consensus.
1.2 Core Hypothesis
Convergence of AI scaling and quantum computing creates shared infrastructure bottleneck (energy + cooling). Information arbitrage opportunity exists in correlating patents, funding, regulatory actions, and academic research before signals reach mainstream analyst coverage.
1.3 Success Criteria

Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Agent surfaces 15-20 signals daily, user provides training feedback via thumbs up/down
Phase 2 (Week 3+): Agent achieves 70%+ user approval rate on Top 3 daily signals
Phase 3 (Month 2+): User identifies 2-3 actionable trades/month from agent signals with 12-18 month time horizon

4. Signal Correlation & Synthesis
4.1 Correlation Logic
Agent identifies convergence patterns across sources within 90-day windows:
Pattern Type 1: Timeline Clustering
Multiple independent signals on same technology/company:
Example:

Day 1: MIT paper on graphene-based phase-change cooling material
Day 22: Google files patent on data centre cooling using similar approach
Day 35: DOE announces $40M ARPA-E grant, MIT is recipient
Day 48: Vertiv SEC filing shows 30% capex increase + "strategic partnership" mention

Agent synthesis: "4 signals in 48 days around graphene cooling. Strong convergence. Commercial deployment timeline: 12-18 months. Vertiv likely beneficiary."
Pattern Type 2: Supply Chain Mapping
Identify upstream/downstream relationships:
Example:

Startup patents novel cooling fluid
30 days later: Cooling system manufacturer (Vertiv) files patent citing startup's fluid
60 days later: Hyperscaler (Google) announces partnership with Vertiv
90 days later: Fluid startup announces Series B funding from Google Ventures

Agent synthesis: "Supply chain forming: Startup (material) → Vertiv (system integrator) → Google (end customer). Google has strategic interest (GV investment). M&A likelihood: Vertiv acquires startup within 18 months, or Google acquires both."
Pattern Type 3: Validation Cascade
Early-stage signal gets validated by subsequent events:
Example:

University paper on solid-state battery breakthrough (TRL 3, no immediate commercial path)
120 days later: Startup founded by paper authors, announces $20M Series A from Lux Capital
180 days later: Automotive OEM announces partnership for pilot production
240 days later: Patent filed with manufacturing-ready claims (TRL 6)

Agent synthesis: "Initially weak signal (academic) progressively validated by VC backing, industry partnership, manufacturing patent. Time-to-market accelerating. Watch for Series B announcement (likely 6-12 months) and OEM commitment to production (12-18 months)."
4.2 Contrarian Analysis (Built Into Every Top 3 Signal)
For each strong signal, agent identifies risks that could invalidate the thesis:
Regulatory Risk

"NRC approval process for SMR designs averages 5-7 years. Company claims 18-month deployment assumes design certification already complete—verify before investing."

Technical Risk

"Graphene cooling material shows 50% efficiency improvement in lab. Manufacturing at scale remains unproven. If costs don't drop below $X/kg, adoption limited to hyperscaler-only (not mid-market data centres)."

Market Risk

"Vertiv stock up 18% this quarter. Some cooling demand signal may already be priced in. Check if institutional ownership increased (suggests consensus forming) or retail-driven (suggests hype)."

Geopolitical Risk

"Rare earth supply chain concentrated in China. US-China tensions could disrupt supply for permanent magnets used in cooling pumps. Diversification efforts underway but 3-5 year timeline."

Competitive Risk

"Three other startups working on similar solid-state battery chemistry. Patent landscape crowded. M&A premium may be lower than expected due to alternatives."

5. User Training & Feedback Loop
5.1 Phase 1 - Training Mode (Weeks 1-2)
Objective
Agent learns user's mental model through explicit feedback.
Process
Daily Digest (15-20 Candidates):

Agent uses lower threshold (score ≥5 instead of ≥7)
Deliberately includes borderline signals to learn boundaries
Every signal has: [👍 Relevant] [➡️ Neutral] [👎 Noise] buttons

User Action:

👍 = "More like this" (agent boosts similar signals)
➡️ = "Unsure, keep showing occasionally" (agent maintains current weighting)
👎 = "Waste of my time" (agent deprioritises similar signals)

What Agent Learns:
From technology category ratings:

User 👍 8/10 liquid cooling signals → increase cooling weight by 20%
User 👎 7/10 battery storage signals → decrease battery weight by 30%
User ➡️ all fusion signals → maintain current weighting, show 1-2/week for ongoing calibration

From player type ratings:

User 👍 startup signals with Lux Capital backing → increase Lux portfolio weight
User 👎 university research without VC backing → deprioritise academic-only signals
User 👍 defense prime signals → add more BAE/Lockheed monitoring

From attention metrics ratings:

User 👍 signals with high citation velocity (75% of approvals) → increase attention multiplier weight
User 👎 signals with social media hype but no substance (10% of approvals) → decrease HN/Twitter weight

From TRL ratings:

User 👍 TRL 6-7, 👎 TRL 3-4 → tighten TRL filter to 6+
User occasionally 👍 TRL 3-4 from Google/Microsoft → exception: allow early-stage if Tier 1 player

From novelty ratings:

User 👍 signals showing 5-10x improvements → increase novelty threshold
User 👎 incremental (20%) improvements → filter out unless other strong signals (government funding, Tier 1 player)

Daily Learning Summary (Bottom of digest):

"Based on today's ratings: You prefer [cooling > hydrogen > SMRs]. You favor [VC-backed startups > university research]. You prioritize [high citation velocity > social media hype]. Adjusting tomorrow's signals accordingly."

Suggested Adjustments for Week 2:
1. Increase cooling coverage from 25% → 40% of daily signals
2. Decrease battery storage from 20% → 10%
3. Filter out university research unless funded by ARPA-E/BEV or partnered with Tier 1
4. Increase weight on citation velocity (attention multiplier)
5. Decrease weight on social media mentions

Approve all adjustments? [Yes] [No - I'll specify]
User approves adjustments → Agent tunes algorithm for Week 2
5.2 Phase 2 - Auto-Pilot Mode (Week 3+)
Objective
Agent operates autonomously with minimal user input, only surfacing high-confidence signals.
Process
Daily Digest (10-12 Candidates):

Agent uses tighter threshold (score ≥7, incorporating learned preferences)
Top 3 pre-ranked by agent (highest scores after applying user preference weights)
Next 7-9 provided as "Also interesting, rate if you disagree"

User Action:

Light touch: Only rate if agent got something wrong

👍 = "You ranked this too low, should've been Top 3"
👎 = "You ranked this too high, shouldn't be here"
No rating = "Agent got it right, keep going"



Continuous Learning:

Agent tracks disagreement rate (how often user overrides agent's ranking)
If disagreement >30% for 3 consecutive days → agent flags "Need recalibration, requesting more feedback"
If disagreement <10% for 7 consecutive days → agent increases confidence, may tighten threshold further (score ≥8)

Monthly Deep Calibration (First Sunday of Month):
MONTH 1 PERFORMANCE REVIEW

Signals Delivered:
- Total: 280 signals (20/day × 14 days training + 10/day × 14 days auto-pilot)
- Top 3 delivered: 42 (21 days × 2 after weekend accumulation)
- User 👍 on Top 3: 34/42 (81% approval rate) ✅ Exceeds 70% target

Technology Breakdown:
- Cooling: 42% of signals, 8.4/10 avg rating ✅
- Hydrogen: 18% of signals, 7.1/10 avg rating ✅
- SMR: 12% of signals, 5.8/10 avg rating ⚠️ Still borderline, consider further reduction
- Quantum: 15% of signals, 7.8/10 avg rating ✅
- Battery: 8% of signals, 4.2/10 avg rating ⚠️ Still too low quality, reduce further
- Other: 5% of signals, 6.5/10 avg rating ✅

Player Quality:
- Tier 1 signals: 65% of Top 3 ✅
- Tier 2 signals: 30% of Top 3 ✅
- Tier 3 signals: 5% of Top 3 (all had high attention scores) ✅

Time-to-Market Accuracy:
- Signals with "12-18 month" timeline: 28 delivered
  - User hasn't traded yet (too early to validate) - check Month 6
- Signals with "6-12 month" timeline: 8 delivered
  - User traded on 2, watching 4 others - check Month 3 for outcomes

False Positive Rate:
- Signals user rated 👎 after initially being Top 3: 8/42 (19%)
- Primary reasons: "Already priced in" (4), "Regulatory risk too high" (3), "Competitive landscape too crowded" (1)

Recommended Adjustments:
1. Reduce SMR coverage from 12% → 8% (user ratings still lukewarm)
2. Reduce battery from 8% → 5% (user ratings consistently low)
3. Increase "contrarian check" depth (user dinged 4 signals for "already priced in")
4. Add "institutional ownership check" to meta-signals (requires Crunchbase Pro or manual Bloomberg check)

New Features to Consider:
1. Add "regulatory timeline tracker" for SMR/fusion (user wants realistic deployment timelines)
2. Add "patent landscape density check" (user wants to know if space is crowded before investing)
3. Add "quarterly earnings call mention tracker" for public companies (requires transcripts)

Approve adjustments? [Yes] [No - I'll specify]
Try new features? [Yes - all] [Yes - select] [No - wait]
5.3 Long-Term Optimization (Month 3+)
Feedback Loops Beyond User Ratings
Outcome Tracking (If user opts in):

User can mark signals as: "Traded on this", "Watching", "Passed"
For "Traded" signals, user can later report outcome: "Profitable", "Breakeven", "Loss", "Too early"
Agent learns: Which signal patterns led to profitable trades vs losses

Example:

Month 1: User 👍 cooling startup signal (Submer + Microsoft partnership)
Month 2: User marks "Traded on this - bought Submer via private secondary market"
Month 8: User marks outcome "Profitable - Microsoft acquired Submer, 3x return"
Agent learns: "Microsoft partnership signals" + "immersion cooling" + "employee hiring spike" = high-quality M&A indicator → boost similar patterns in future

Calibration Confidence Intervals:

After 3 months, agent calculates prediction accuracy:

"Signals agent scored 12+ had 85% user approval rate"
"Signals agent scored 7-9 had 65% user approval rate"
"Time-to-market predictions: 70% accuracy within ±3 months"


Agent uses this to add confidence bands to scores:

"Score 12.5 (High confidence - 85% historical approval)"
"Score 8.1 (Medium confidence - 65% historical approval)"

Usage: Very light weighting in attention score (user feedback during training will likely show low value)
6.3 Scoring Engine
Input: Raw signals from all collectors (50-200 signals/day)
Process:
Step 1: Base Scoring
pythondef calculate_base_score(signal):
    score = 0
    
    # Convergence check (requires correlation module, see below)
    if signal['num_correlated_sources'] >= 2:
        score += 3
    
    # Government alignment
    if signal['matches_government_programme']:
        score += 2
    
    # Capital commitment
    if signal['type'] == 'funding':
        if signal['amount'] >= 100_000_000 and signal['geography'] == 'US':
            score += 2
        elif signal['amount'] >= 20_000_000 and signal['geography'] in ['UK', 'EU']:
            score += 3
        elif signal['amount'] >= 500_000_000:
            score += 3
    
    # TRL check
    if signal['estimated_trl'] in [5, 6, 7]:
        score += 2
    
    # Player credibility
    if signal['player_tier'] == 1:
        score += 2
    elif signal['player_tier'] == 2:
        score += 1
    
    # M&A likelihood (requires manual tagging or ML model)
    if signal['ma_likelihood'] == 'high':
        score += 1
    
    # Novelty/impact
    if signal['impact_level'] in ['substantial', 'transformative']:
        score += 1
    
    # Macro tailwind
    if signal['macro_alignment']:
        score += 1
    
    return score
Step 2: Attention Multiplier
pythondef calculate_attention_score(signal):
    attention = 0
    
    if signal['type'] == 'paper':
        citations_30d = signal.get('citations_30_days', 0)
        cohort_avg = get_cohort_average_citations(signal['arxiv_category'])
        
        if citations_30d > cohort_avg * 3:  # Top 5% rough proxy
            attention = 3
        elif citations_30d > cohort_avg * 1.5:
            attention = 2
        elif citations_30d > 0:
            attention = 1
    
    if signal['type'] == 'patent':
        forward_citations = signal.get('forward_citations_90d', 0)
        if forward_citations >= 3:
            attention = 3
        elif forward_citations >= 1:
            attention = 2
    
    if signal['type'] == 'sec_filing':
        stock_change = signal.get('stock_pct_change_on_filing', 0)
        if abs(stock_change) >= 3:
            attention = 3
        elif abs(stock_change) >= 1:
            attention = 2
    
    if signal.get('github_stars_14d', 0) >= 500:
        attention = max(attention, 3)
    elif signal.get('github_stars_14d', 0) >= 100:
        attention = max(attention, 2)
    
    if signal.get('media_tier_1_coverage'):  # FT, MIT Tech Review
        attention = max(attention, 3)
    elif signal.get('media_tier_2_coverage'):  # TechCrunch, IEEE Spectrum
        attention = max(attention, 2)
    
    return attention
Step 3: Final Score Calculation
pythondef calculate_final_score(signal):
    base = calculate_base_score(signal)
    attention = calculate_attention_score(signal)
    
    final = base * (1 + attention * 0.2)
    
    return final
Step 4: User Preference Weighting (After Training Phase)
pythondef apply_user_preferences(signal, final_score):
    # Example: User prefers cooling (weight 1.3x) over batteries (weight 0.7x)
    tech_weights = get_learned_tech_weights(user_id)
    
    if signal['technology_category'] in tech_weights:
        final_score *= tech_weights[signal['technology_category']]
    
    # Example: User prefers Lux Capital-backed startups
    player_weights = get_learned_player_weights(user_id)
    
    if signal['vc_firm'] in player_weights:
        final_score *= player_weights[signal['vc_firm']]
    
    return final_score
6.4 Correlation Module
Purpose: Identify convergence patterns across different signal sources
Approach: Time-windowed clustering on technology/company entities
Step 1: Entity Extraction

    # Company extraction
    for company in KNOWN_COMPANIES:  # Tier 1/2 list

    for tech in TECHNOLOGY_KEYWORDS:
        if tech.lower() in text.lower():
            entities['technologies'].append(tech)

        if len(cluster) >= 2:  # Convergence = 2+ signals
            clusters.append(cluster)
    
    return clusters
Step 3: Convergence Scoring
pythondef score_convergence(cluster):

        score += 1
    
    return score

6.5 Synthesis Module
Purpose: Generate human-readable analysis for Top 3 signals
Input: High-scoring signal clusters

            <li><strong>Time horizon:</strong> 12-18 months (pilot deployment → broader rollout)</li>
            <li><strong>Catalysts:</strong> Vertiv partnership announcement (likely Q2 2026), Google I/O demo (May 2026), commercial availability (Q4 2026 - Q1 2027)</li>

            <li><strong>Material risk:</strong> Graphene manufacturing at scale remains unproven. If costs don't drop below $500/kg, adoption limited to hyperscaler-only.</li>
            <li><strong>Already priced in:</strong> Vertiv stock up 18% this quarter. Check if institutional ownership increased (suggests smart money positioning) vs retail-driven (hype).</li>
            <li><strong>Competition:</strong> 3M, Boyd, others working on phase-change materials. Patent landscape crowded - need to verify Google's IP is defensible.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Suggested Action:</strong> Research Vertiv's institutional ownership trends. If increasing, consider 2-3% position with 12-month horizon. Stop-loss at -15%. Monitor for partnership announcement as confirmation signal.</p>

Thumbs Up/Down Mechanism:

Each button links to agent API endpoint with signal ID + rating
User clicks → HTTP GET request → agent records rating → returns confirmation page
Rating stored in database, used for weekly calibration

Alternative (If Email Links Don't Work):

Provide "Reply to this email with: +123 (thumbs up signal 123), -456 (thumbs down signal 456)"
Agent parses email replies, extracts ratings

### 6.8 Critical Alert System (SMS/WhatsApp)

**Trigger Condition**: Final score ≥12 (extremely rare, strong convergence + high attention)

**Implementation Options**:

**Option A: Twilio** (SMS/WhatsApp API)
- Cost: ~$0.01 per SMS, ~$0.005 per WhatsApp message
- Setup: Requires Twilio account, phone number verification
- Reliability: High

**Option B: Email-to-SMS Gateway**
- Cost: Free (if user's mobile carrier supports it)
- Setup: Send email to `[phone]@[carrier-gateway].com` (e.g., `5551234567@tmomail.net` for T-Mobile)
- Reliability: Medium (some carriers filter)

**Recommended**: Start with **Option B** (free), upgrade to Twilio if unreliable

**Message Format** (SMS - 160 char limit):
```
🚨 CRITICAL SIGNAL (Score 12.3): Google/Vertiv graphene cooling partnership + $40M DOE grant. Check email for full analysis. Reply STOP to disable alerts.
```

**Message Format** (WhatsApp - no limit):
```
🚨 CRITICAL SIGNAL

Full analysis in today's digest (check email).
Delivery Timing: Immediate (not batched with daily digest)

7. Deployment & Operations
7.1 Hosting
Phase 1 (MVP): Local machine or single VPS

Option A: Run on user's laptop (requires agent to be always-on, or scheduled via cron)
Option B: DigitalOcean/AWS EC2 small instance ($10-20/month)

Phase 2 (Production): Cloud-hosted, redundant

AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for serverless (scales to zero when not running, only pay for compute time)
Database: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) or managed SQLite (LiteStream for backups)

Recommended for Phase 1: DigitalOcean Droplet ($12/month, 2GB RAM, sufficient for SQLite + Python)
7.2 Scheduling
Daily Collection Cycle: 10 PM - 7 AM UK time (overnight processing)

10:00 PM: Begin data collection
11:00 PM: Patents
12:00 AM: SEC/Companies House
1:00 AM: Academic papers (ArXiv posts at midnight ET / 5 AM UK)
2:00 AM: Government sources
3:00 AM: News aggregation
4:00 AM: Social signals
5:00 AM: Scoring, correlation, synthesis
6:00 AM: Report generation
7:00 AM: Email sent

Implementation: Cron job or systemd timer (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
bash# Example cron entry (runs daily at 10 PM)
0 22 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /opt/energy-intel-agent/main.py --mode daily_collection
```

**Weekend Handling**:
- Cron skips Saturday/Sunday (`0 22 * * 1-5` = Monday-Friday only)
- Monday digest includes Friday PM + weekend signals

**Critical Alert Monitoring**:
- Separate cron job checks for score ≥12 signals every 2 hours during business hours
- `0 */2 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/python3 /opt/energy-intel-agent/main.py --mode critical_alert_check`

### 7.3 Error Handling & Monitoring

**Collection Failures**:
- If USPTO website down → skip patent collection for that day, retry next day, log warning
- If SEC EDGAR rate-limited → implement exponential backoff, queue requests
- If ArXiv API times out → retry 3 times, then skip

**Notification**:
- If collection fails for 2+ consecutive days → send alert email to user
- "Warning: Patent collection failed for 2 days. Check agent logs."

**Logging**:
- All collection runs logged to file: `/var/log/energy-intel-agent/collection.log`
- Includes: timestamp, data source, records collected, errors encountered

**Health Checks**:
- Daily self-check: "Did I send a digest yesterday? If not, why?"
- Weekly self-check: "Is database growing? (Should have ~500-1000 new signals/week)"

### 7.4 Security & Privacy

**Email Delivery**:
- User's email address stored in config file (not in database)
- Use SMTP with TLS (encrypt email in transit)

**Thumbs Up/Down API**:
- Generate unique token for each signal+user combination
- `https://agent-api.com/rate/{signal_id}/{token}/up`
- Token expires after 30 days (old ratings no longer accepted)
- Prevents tampering: user can't modify someone else's ratings

**Data Privacy**:
- All data stored locally (user's VPS or machine)
- No third-party analytics or tracking
- User can delete database at any time to reset agent

**API Keys** (For Phase 2 paid sources):
- Store in environment variables (not in code)
- Use secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, or simple `.env` file with restricted permissions)

### 7.5 Backup & Recovery

**Database Backup**:
- Daily backup to separate location (S3, Dropbox, external drive)
- Keep 30 days of backups (rolling deletion)

**Disaster Recovery**:
- If agent fails completely, user can reinstall and restore database backup
- User ratings preserved, no re-training required

**Agent Code Updates**:
- Use Git for version control
- User can pull updates: `git pull origin main && systemctl restart energy-intel-agent`

## 8. Success Metrics & Validation

### 8.1 Phase 1 Success Criteria (Weeks 1-2, Training Mode)

**Metric 1**: User rates 80%+ of delivered signals
- **Target**: ≥12 ratings per day out of 15 signals delivered
- **Failure mode**: User ignoring digest = not valuable enough

**Metric 2**: Clear preference patterns emerge
- **Target**: After 2 weeks, ≥3 technology categories have distinct approval rates (e.g., cooling 8/10, batteries 3/10)
- **Failure mode**: All ratings uniform = agent not surfacing diverse enough signals

**Metric 3**: User reports actionable insights
- **Target**: User flags ≥2 signals as "worth researching further"
- **Failure mode**: All signals feel like noise = scoring model broken

### 8.2 Phase 2 Success Criteria (Week 3+, Auto-Pilot Mode)

**Metric 1**: Top 3 approval rate ≥70%
- **Target**: User 👍 at least 2 out of 3 Top 3 signals daily
- **Current**: 81% (from training phase) ✅

**Metric 2**: Low disagreement rate
- **Target**: User overrides agent ranking <20% of the time
- **Failure mode**: User constantly moving signals between Top 3 and Interesting = agent misjudging

**Metric 3**: User reduces rating frequency
- **Target**: User only rates 3-5 signals/day (disagreements only), not all 10-12
- **Indicates**: Agent learned preferences well enough to operate semi-autonomously

### 8.3 Phase 3 Success Criteria (Month 2+, Outcome Tracking)

**Metric 1**: Actionable trades identified
- **Target**: ≥2-3 signals/month where user marks "Traded on this" or "Researching for trade"
- **Ultimate success**: User attributes profitable trade to agent signal

**Metric 2**: Signal lead time
- **Target**: Signals surface 12-18 months before mainstream analyst coverage
- **Validation**: Check if FT/Bloomberg covers same topic 6-12 months later

**Metric 3**: False positive rate acceptable
- **Target**: <25% of Top 3 signals rated 👎 after initial delivery
- **Current**: 19% (from training phase) ✅

### 8.4 Long-Term Validation (Month 6+)

**Backtest Historical Accuracy**:
- Identify market moves from Jan-Jun 2026
- Check: Would agent have flagged the signals 12-18 months prior (July 2024 - Dec 2025)?
- Example: If Vertiv acquired a cooling startup in April 2026, did agent flag partnership signals in Oct 2024 - Jan 2025?

**User Testimonial**:
- "Did this help you make money?" (binary yes/no)
- "Would you pay for this?" (validates productization potential)

**Refinement Roadmap**:
- Based on 6-month learnings, identify which data sources mattered most
- Double down on high-value sources, cut low-value ones
- User decides: Keep running for personal use, or productize for others?

---

## 9. Phase 1 Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure

**Days 1-2: Data Collection (Patents, SEC)**
- Build USPTO collector (search, parse, store)
- Build SEC EDGAR collector (8-K, 10-Q, 10-K parsing)
- Test: Can agent fetch 10-20 patents/day and 5-10 SEC filings/day?

**Days 3-4: Data Collection (Papers, Gov, News)**
- Build ArXiv collector
- Build DOE/UKRI collectors
- Build FT RSS scraper (user has access)
- Test: Can agent fetch 20-30 papers/day, 5-10 grant announcements/week, 10-20 news articles/day?

**Days 5-7: Scoring Engine**
- Implement base scoring logic
- Implement attention score logic
- Test: Can agent score 50 signals and rank them?

### Week 2: Synthesis & Delivery

**Days 8-9: Correlation & Synthesis**
- Build entity extraction (companies, technologies)
- Build convergence detection (time-windowed clustering)
- Test: Can agent identify 2-3 convergence clusters from 100 signals?

**Days 10-11: Email Generation**
- Build HTML email template
- Implement thumbs up/down API (simple Flask/FastAPI endpoint)
- Test: Can agent send formatted digest to user's email?

**Days 12-14: End-to-End Testing**
- Run full pipeline: Collection → Scoring → Correlation → Synthesis → Email
- User receives first digest, provides feedback on format/content
- Fix bugs, tune thresholds

### Week 3-4: Training Mode & Refinement

**Week 3**:
- User rates signals daily
- Agent logs all ratings, begins learning
- Mid-week check-in: Adjust any obvious issues (e.g., too many low-quality signals)

**Week 4**:
- Continue training mode
- Sunday Week 2: First calibration report
- User reviews, approves adjustments
- Agent transitions to auto-pilot mode (Week 3+)

### Month 2: Validation & Optimization

**Weeks 5-8**:
- Agent runs in auto-pilot
- User provides minimal feedback (only on disagreements)
- Weekly/monthly calibration reports
- User identifies 1-2 signals worth trading on → validates usefulness

**End of Month 2**:
- Decision point: Continue with free data sources, or upgrade to paid (Crunchbase Pro, PatentSight)?
- Decision point: Is agent valuable enough to keep running long-term?

---

## 10. Cost Estimate

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4, Free Sources Only)

**Development Time**:
- Assumes user is comfortable with Python scripting, or outsources to developer
- Estimated: 40-60 hours (1-2 weeks full-time equivalent)
- **Cost**: $0 if user builds, or $2,000-5,000 if outsourced (freelancer rates)

**Infrastructure**:
- DigitalOcean Droplet: $12/month
- Domain name (if needed for API): $12/year
- **Total Month 1**: ~$15

**Data Sources**:
- All free (USPTO, SEC, ArXiv, Lens.org, FT subscription user already has)
- **Total**: $0

**Claude API** (for synthesis generation):
- Assume 20 signals/day × 500 tokens/synthesis × 30 days = 300K tokens/month
- Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens
- Estimate: $1 input + $5 output = **$6/month**

**Total Month 1**: $21 (ongoing) + $2,000-5,000 (one-time dev)

### Phase 2 (Month 2+, Validated, Considering Paid Sources)

**Data Sources** (If Validated Valuable):
- Crunchbase Pro: $125/month (£1,500/year)
- Lens.org Plus: £40/month (£500/year)
- **Total**: $165/month (~£1,750/year)

**Infrastructure**: $12/month (same)

**Claude API**: $6/month (same, usage unlikely to change significantly)

**Total Month 2+**: $183/month (~£150/month, £1,800/year)

### ROI Calculation

**Break-even**: Agent needs to identify ONE trade/year that makes >£2,000 profit

**Realistic target**: If agent surfaces 2-3 actionable trades/month, and user's hit rate is 50%, and avg profit per winning trade is £5,000, then:
- 1.5 winning trades/month × £5,000 = £7,500/month profit
- Agent cost: £150/month
- **ROI**: 50x 🎯

**Failure mode**: If agent surfaces zero actionable trades in 6 months → shut down, total loss £900

## 11. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

**User**:
1. Confirm final spec (approve/request changes)
2. Set up DigitalOcean account + Droplet (or decide to run locally)
3. Provide email address for digest delivery
4. Confirm phone number for critical alerts (SMS/WhatsApp)

**Developer** (Claude or outsourced):
1. Set up Python environment (libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, sqlite3, anthropic, smtplib)
2. Build Week 1 components (data collectors)
3. Test USPTO + SEC collectors, verify data quality

**End of Week 1 Deliverable**: Agent can collect 50+ signals/day from patents + SEC

### Week 2: Build Synthesis & Delivery

**Developer**:
1. Build scoring engine
2. Build correlation/synthesis modules
3. Build email generator + thumbs API
4. Send first test digest to user

**User**:
1. Review first digest, provide feedback on format/content
2. Test thumbs up/down buttons (do they work?)

**End of Week 2 Deliverable**: Agent sends formatted digest daily, user can rate signals

### Week 3-4: Training & Tuning

**User**:
1. Rate 15-20 signals daily (👍👎)
2. Provide qualitative feedback ("This signal was noise because...", "I'd love to see more of...")

**Agent**:
1. Log all ratings
2. Generate weekly calibration reports
3. Tune algorithm based on user feedback

**End of Week 4 Deliverable**: Agent has learned user preferences, ready for auto-pilot mode (70%+ approval rate on Top 3)

### Month 2: Validate & Optimize

**User**:
1. Trade on 1-2 signals (if any are actionable)
2. Report outcomes (profitable, breakeven, loss, too early)

**Agent**:
1. Track outcome data
2. Refine time-to-market predictions based on actual results

**End of Month 2**: Decision on whether to:
- **Continue**: Agent is valuable, consider upgrading to paid data sources
- **Pause**: Not valuable yet, but keep running to see if improves
- **Shut down**: Not working, cut losses

---

## 12. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Signal Overload (Too Much Noise)

**Symptom**: User receives 15-20 signals/day, feels overwhelmed, stops rating

**Mitigation**:
- Week 2 of training: Tighten threshold from score ≥5 → ≥6 if user requests
- Add "snooze" option: "Hide battery storage signals for 1 week" if user consistently rates them low
- Monthly check-in: "Are you getting too many signals? Should I reduce volume?"

### Risk 2: Signal Drought (Too Little Signal)

**Symptom**: Agent delivers only 3-5 signals/day, user feels they're missing opportunities

**Mitigation**:
- Expand data sources (add more patent categories, more news sources)
- Lower threshold temporarily to surface more borderline signals
- User provides examples of signals they wished agent had caught

### Risk 3: Data Source Failures

**Symptom**: USPTO website down for 3 days, agent can't collect patents

**Mitigation**:
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- If source down >2 days, send alert to user: "Warning: Patent collection offline, may miss signals"
- Maintain 7-day buffer: If USPTO down Monday, retry Tuesday, Wednesday, etc., until success

### Risk 4: User Disengagement

**Symptom**: User stops rating signals after Week 1, agent can't learn

**Mitigation**:
- Gamification: "You've rated 95/100 signals this week! 🎯"
- Weekly summary: "Your ratings helped me improve cooling signal quality by 30%"
- Simplify rating: Instead of 👍➡️👎, just 👍👎 (binary)

### Risk 5: Claude API Costs Spike

**Symptom**: Synthesis generation uses more tokens than expected, bill jumps to $50/month

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor token usage daily
- If >500 tokens/synthesis, optimize prompt (make it more concise)
- Set hard limit: $20/month API spend, if exceeded, switch to simpler template-based synthesis (no Claude API)

### Risk 6: Agent Never Surfaces Actionable Trade

**Symptom**: 6 months in, user hasn't traded on a single signal

**Possible causes**:
- User's standards too high (waiting for "perfect" signal that doesn't exist)
- Agent surfacing signals too late (already priced in by the time user sees them)
- Agent surfacing wrong types of signals (academic papers with no commercial path)

**Mitigation**:
- Month 3 retrospective: Review past Top 3 signals, ask user "Which of these would you have traded on if X condition were met?"
- Adjust scoring to prioritize "tradeable" signals (publicly listed companies, not private startups)
- Consider adding "Paper trading" mode: User marks "I would've traded on this", agent tracks hypothetical outcomes

---

## 13. Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 1)

### Enhancement 1: Multi-User Support

**Why**: If agent works well for one user, could work for others (productization opportunity)

**Changes needed**:
- Multi-tenant database (separate user_preferences per user_id)
- Separate email digests per user
- Shared signal collection (USPTO scraping once, serves all users), but personalized ranking/synthesis

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks development

**Revenue potential**: $50-200/month per user (subscription model)

### Enhancement 2: Interactive Dashboard

**Why**: Email digest is good for daily updates, but user may want to explore past signals

**Features**:
- Web UI showing all signals from past 30 days
- Filter by: technology, player, score, date
- Search: "Show me all Google patents from last quarter"
- Bookmark signals: "I'm watching this, remind me in 3 months"

**Tech stack**: Flask/Django (Python web framework), simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks development

### Enhancement 3: Slack/Discord Integration

**Why**: User may prefer Slack/Discord over email (especially if running this for a team)

**Changes needed**:
- Build Slack bot or Discord webhook
- Send daily digest as Slack message with interactive buttons
- User rates via emoji reactions (👍👎)

**Effort**: 3-5 days development

### Enhancement 4: Automated Trading Integration

**Why**: If signals are consistently profitable, automate the trading (high risk, user must opt-in)

**Features**:
- Connect to brokerage API (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers)
- Agent places trades automatically when score ≥12 + user-defined criteria met
- Position sizing based on conviction score
- Automatic stop-loss orders

**Effort**: 2-4 weeks development + extensive testing

**Risk**: High. Requires user to trust agent with capital. Recommend paper trading for 6+ months first.

### Enhancement 5: Market Sentiment Analysis

**Why**: Correlate agent signals with broader market sentiment (are we early, or is everyone talking about this?)

**Data sources**:
- Google Trends (search volume for technologies)
- Twitter sentiment (mentions of companies/technologies)
- Reddit discussion volume

**Output**: "Signal strength: High. Market sentiment: Low (we're early). Trade confidence: High."

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks development

### Enhancement 6: Supply Chain Mapping Visualization

**Why**: Help user understand relationships between players

**Features**:
- Graph visualization showing: Startups → Component suppliers → System integrators → End customers
- Example: MIT (graphene material) → Google (adopter) → Vertiv (manufacturer) → Data centre operators

**Tech stack**: D3.js or Cytoscape.js for interactive graphs

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks development
