## Lens API Integration ✅
- Matt provided Lens.org API key (14-day trial, expires ~Feb 23)
- Key saved to energy-agent/.env
- Fixed LensPatentCollector:
  - Removed `claims.claim_text` from search fields (400 error)
  - Fixed `include` param (used wrong field names like `title`, `applicants`)
  - Fixed title extraction: `biblio.invention_title[0].text` not `title`
  - Fixed applicant extraction: `biblio.parties.applicants[].extracted_name.value`
- Fixed LensScholarCollector:
  - Fixed include fields (`scholarly_citations_count`, `external_ids`)
  - Fixed DOI extraction from `external_ids` array
- Wired both collectors into `main.py` (LensPatentCollector + LensScholarCollector)
- Test run: **222 patents** collected across 7 domains! 🎯
- Scholarly collector not tested yet but should work
- Scholarly endpoint returning 401 — may need separate token or activation
