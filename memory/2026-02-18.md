## Energy Intelligence Pipeline
- **Energy Digest Agent SUCCESS** - 1,435 signals collected (314 ArXiv, 277 SEC, 500 OSINT, 244 Lens patents, 100 USPTO)
- Analysis: 106 strong signals (≥7), 464 interesting (≥4), 227 new signals stored
- ✅ Email delivered to oc@cloudmonkey.io
- ✅ Posted to X (@AlphaENRG): https://x.com/AlphaENRG/status/2024013950539423822
- **Daily OpenClaw Intelligence Brief** started at 08:00 GMT - automated market research and trends analysis

## System Status
- Confirmed running on **Mac Mini M4** (not MacBook Air)
- Current model: **Claude Sonnet 4** (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Matt asked about Opus 4.6 availability (alias: `senior-dev`)
- No SKILLS.md file exists, but TOOLS.md contains local setup notes

## Heartbeat Checks
- **Continuous rotations**: Multiple heartbeat cycles completed throughout the day
- **Persistent issue**: Workspace remains consistently dirty with uncommitted changes:
  - `MEMORY.md` (modified)
  - `memory/heartbeat-state.json` (modified) 
  - `alphaenergy-glow2/` (untracked directory)
  - `memory/2026-02-18.md` (untracked)
- **All check types completed**: Ansible sync, Git status, Memory maintenance, Mac Mini ping
- Mac Mini ping: ✅ OpenClaw process running (PID 60822)
- System uptime: 6 days+ (as of 10:42 GMT)
- **Note**: Workspace dirty state reported multiple times but not yet addressed

## Daily Security Audit (09:00 GMT)
- **Overall Status: HIGH RISK** 🔴 - Critical vulnerabilities identified
- **CRITICAL**: Firewall completely disabled (State = 0) - all ports exposed
- **CRITICAL**: Mac Mini self-SSH failure (100.87.48.20) - blocks deployments, 15+ failed Ansible attempts
- **Infrastructure Status**: 
  - Mac Mini: ✅ ONLINE (100.87.48.20)
  - MacBook Air: 🔴 UNREACHABLE (100.87.78.214)
  - Kali Y2K: ✅ BACK ONLINE (100.87.231.197) - restored!
  - Jetson Orin: 🔴 UNREACHABLE (100.87.171.38)
- **Network Services**: Ports 3283, 5000, 7000 exposed on all interfaces
- **Positive**: No unauthorized access detected, core services stable

## Vultr VM Progress (10:04 GMT)
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Matt fixed Netbird connectivity via console (`netbird down/up --allow-server-ssh --enable-ssh-root`)
- **New Status**: Now connected as `vultr-95-131.netbird.cloud` at IP **100.87.95.131** ✅
- **Connection Type**: Relayed via Netbird (working!)
- **Remaining Issue**: SSH authentication - needs correct username/key (not `oc` user)
- **Old IP**: 100.87.221.48 still shows as "Connecting" (stale entry)
- **Progress**: From 1/4 peers connected to 2/4 peers connected

## Infrastructure Notes
- **Netbird Status**: Now 2/4 peers connected (Kali Y2K + Vultr VM)
- **Expected Offline**: MacBook Air and Jetson Orin (Matt confirmed 10:00 GMT - "no issue there")
- Mac Mini firewall still disabled creates significant security exposure
- All core systems operational despite connectivity issues
- **Matt's feedback**: Called me a "smart cookie-claw" for tracking down Vultr IP change
