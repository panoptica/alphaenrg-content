## Energy Intelligence Success - Morning
**6:51 AM GMT**: Energy Digest Agent completed successfully
- **1,396 total signals collected** (ArXiv: 316, SEC: 221, OSINT: 500, Lens.org: 259, USPTO: 100)
- 99 strong signals (≥7 score), 489 interesting signals (≥4 score)
- 99 new signals stored in database
- ✅ Digest email sent to oc@cloudmonkey.io
- ✅ Posted to X/Twitter (@AlphaENRG) - Tweet ID: 2023289178318946328
- ❌ Lens.org scholarly API still failing (401 errors - ongoing issue)
- ❌ Local Ollama connection error noted but non-critical

## Daily OpenClaw Intelligence Brief Launch
**8:00 AM GMT**: Automated research service initiated
- Market opportunity research and trend analysis
- Comprehensive brief with OpenClaw business angles
- Delivery target: oc@cloudmonkey.io

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY AUDIT FINDINGS
**9:02 AM GMT**: Daily Security Audit revealed severe vulnerabilities requiring immediate action

### Critical Issues:
1. **Mac Mini Firewall Completely Disabled** - All services publicly accessible including Control Center :7000/:5000 and Apple Remote Desktop :3283
2. **OpenClaw Prompt Injection Risk** - llama3.1:8b model has web tools enabled without sandboxing (sandbox=off)
3. **Infrastructure Connectivity Issues** - MacBook Air (100.87.78.214) SSH refused, Jetson Orin (100.87.171.38) connection timeout

### High Risk Issues:
- Authentication rate limiting missing on OpenClaw Gateway
- Using Claude Sonnet 4.0 instead of recommended 4.5+ tier
- Y2K authentication concerns (PAM failures detected)

### Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH
**Requires immediate remediation for firewall and prompt injection vulnerabilities**

## Content Creation
**Morning**: Created quantum winter analysis content
- Substack post: "quantum winter is ending" - analysis of quantum infrastructure readiness
- X/Twitter thread (5 tweets) covering quantum advantage in hardware manufacturing
- Focus on contrarian energy plays: $GE, $NVT, $META positioning

## System Operations
- Multiple heartbeat checks performed throughout day
- Persistent issue: `alphaenrg-content/` directory not found for Ansible deployment sync checks
- All other heartbeat checks (git status, memory maintenance, Mac Mini ping) functioning properly
- Mac Mini uptime: 4 days+ with stable load averages

## Infrastructure Status
- Mac Mini: Online, stable, but critical security vulnerabilities
- Kali Y2K: Online with UFW firewall active
- MacBook Air: Offline/misconfigured (SSH refused)
- Jetson Orin: Offline (connection timeout)

## Lessons Learned
- Security audit automation working effectively to identify critical vulnerabilities
- Need to prioritize firewall configuration and sandboxing for production security
- Infrastructure monitoring reveals connectivity issues requiring investigation
- Energy intelligence pipeline resilient despite individual API failures
