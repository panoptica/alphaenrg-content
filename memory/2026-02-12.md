## Critical Infrastructure Fix
**RESOLVED**: Fixed persistent issue with `empire-heartbeat/status.sh` script reporting inaccurate "OFFLINE" status for Tailscale-connected nodes.

**Problem**: Script was using LAN IPs (192.168.154.x) instead of Tailscale IPs, causing Mac Mini M4 and Kali Y2K to appear offline despite being accessible.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Updated device IPs in status.sh:
   - Mac Mini M4: `192.168.154.44` → `100.98.31.10` (Tailscale)
   - Kali Y2K: `192.168.154.193` → `100.127.194.8` (Tailscale)
   - Jetson Orin: kept `192.168.154.124` (not on Tailscale yet)

2. Replaced unreliable `ping` checks with device-specific connectivity tests:
   - Mac Mini: `curl` to Ollama API (port 11434)
   - Kali/Jetson: `nc` SSH checks (port 22)

**Result**: All nodes now correctly report as ✅ ONLINE. This was a recurring operational blocker that's now resolved.

## ALPHAENRG Status Reports
Multiple hourly status reports triggered throughout the session. Key findings:
- X API configured but no automated follower tracking yet
- Empire infrastructure healthy (Mac Mini Ollama + ComfyUI online)
- Kali Y2K and Jetson Orin both accessible via SSH

## X Post Access Issue
Matt sent 3 X/Twitter links for me to analyze and "find top 5 and apply to yourself. Evolve!!" but web_fetch tool blocked by X's anti-bot measures. Still awaiting content to apply insights.

## Technical Status
- Mac Mini M4 Ollama: ✅ ONLINE (Tailscale)
- Kali Y2K OSINT Node: ✅ ONLINE (Tailscale) 
- Jetson Orin: ✅ ONLINE (LAN, needs Tailscale integration)
- OpenClaw Gateway: ✅ RUNNING

## Lessons Learned
- Always use Tailscale IPs for empire monitoring (documented in MEMORY.md)
- `ping` command unavailable in exec environment - use `curl`/`nc` for connectivity checks
- Empire infrastructure is healthier than monitoring suggested - issue was script-based
