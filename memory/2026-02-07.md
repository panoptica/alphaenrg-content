## ComfyUI Image Generation - Production Ready

### Demis Hassabis @ Anfield (FaceID)
- Successfully generated portrait with stadium background
- Full FaceID stack working: SDXL + ViT-bigG CLIP + FaceID Portrait + InsightFace
- Workflow saved: `comfyui-workflows/faceid_portrait_sdxl.json`

### LFC Teenage Fan (txt2img)
- Generated photorealistic teenage boy in LFC kit at Anfield
- Pure SDXL txt2img, no FaceID needed for generic people
- Matt liked it - natural looking

### Lady → Ball Transformation (FaceID)
- Matt sent photo of lady, asked for "20 years younger, going to a ball"
- Generated with FaceID but likeness drifted significantly
- Hair went from blonde to dark, face features changed too much
- **Lesson**: FaceID weight needs tuning for transformations - maybe 0.85-0.9 instead of 0.75
- Also should preserve hair color in prompt

## Energy Agent Issues

### Email Credentials Broken
- Daily 7am digest failed to send
- Gmail app password rejected: `535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted'`
- **Collection worked fine**: 470 signals (317 ArXiv + 153 SEC), 6 strong signals
- Need Matt to regenerate Gmail app password for oc@cloudmonkey.io

### Python Path Fixed
- `daily_digest.sh` had wrong path: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`
- Fixed to `/usr/local/bin/python3`

## Infrastructure Notes
- Mac Mini M4 (192.168.154.44): Ping blocked but ComfyUI responds fine
- ComfyUI API: http://192.168.154.44:8188

## Pending
- [ ] Gmail app password needs regeneration for energy digest
- [ ] Lady ball image - offer to retry with higher FaceID weight + blonde hair preserved
