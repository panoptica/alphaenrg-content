# 2026-02-11 Session Notes

## Critical OpenClaw Config Fix
- Matt killed empire heartbeat monitor (PID 54019)  
- **MAJOR ISSUE FOUND**: OpenClaw config still using LAN IP for Ollama
  - Bad: `"baseUrl": "http://192.168.154.44:11434/v1"`
  - Fixed: `"baseUrl": "http://100.98.31.10:11434/v1"`
- Matt applied the fix - empire now fully on Tailscale VPN
- This resolves any connectivity issues with local models

## AlphaENRG Status: MASSIVE SUCCESS
- **Followers: 1,189** (target was 100!) 
- X API: Fully functional, posting ready
- Empire infrastructure: All systems GREEN
- No technical blockers
- Matt excited about monetization: "Let's make some mullah!"

## Empire Infrastructure Health
- Mac Mini M4: ✅ All systems operational via Tailscale
- Ollama: ✅ 5 models loaded and accessible  
- ComfyUI: ✅ Online, good resource availability
- Hourly status reports: All checks passing

## Key Lesson Reinforced
- **ALWAYS use Tailscale IPs** for empire connectivity
- LAN IPs cause intermittent issues - VPN is reliable
- Monitor configs regularly for drift back to LAN addressing

## Next Phase: Revenue Generation
- Technical foundation is bulletproof
- Focus shifting from infrastructure to monetization
- AlphaENRG ready for premium subscriber conversion
