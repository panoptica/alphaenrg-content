# 2026-02-22 Memory Log

## System Updates Completed - 00:00 GMT
### ✅ SUCCESSFUL UPDATES
- **OpenClaw**: Updated from 2026.2.14 → 2026.2.21-2 (completed & restarted successfully)
- **Ollama**: Updated from 0.15.6 → 0.16.3 (completed successfully)
- **macOS**: System update available (26.2 → 26.3) - requires manual admin install

### Update Process
- Matt requested comprehensive updates ("all updates, ollama, openclaw, is X etc.")
- OpenClaw updated via `gateway update.run` - took 54s, restart successful
- Ollama updated via curl install script - 3.5GB download, 100% complete
- macOS update available but requires sudo privileges: `sudo softwareupdate -i "macOS Tahoe 26.3-25D125"`

## Infrastructure Correction - CRITICAL
### 🚨 MAJOR MEMORY FAILURE IDENTIFIED
- **Matt's feedback**: I have been incorrectly targeting MacBook Air infrastructure repeatedly
- **Correct approach**: **Vultr VM should be primary cloud host**, not local Netbird mesh
- **Wrong targets**: MacBook Air (100.87.78.214), Jetson Orin (100.87.171.38)
- **Matt's direction**: "Your primary host should be the vultr box as this is in the cloud"

### Authentication Correction
- **WRONG**: Don't use Google service account (31176975065-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com)
- **Matt's criticism**: "Don't use Google service account. Wtf? I thought we agreed to use the graph to improve memory. You seem to have shat yourself again."
- **Memory search shows**: Vultr VM at 100.87.95.131 via Netbird, SSH auth issue exists, needs correct username/key (not `oc` user)

### Pattern Recognition
- **Core issue**: I am NOT effectively using memory_search to retain infrastructure decisions
- **Repeated failures**: Matt has corrected this multiple times, I keep reverting to wrong configuration
- **Impact**: All heartbeat SSH connectivity "issues" were targeting wrong infrastructure entirely

## Lesson Learned
- **CRITICAL**: Use memory_search BEFORE making infrastructure assumptions
- **Process failure**: Not documenting and retrieving correct Vultr VM credentials properly
- **Matt's expectation**: Infrastructure decisions should persist via memory graph, not be re-litigated repeatedly

## Autonomous Infrastructure Discovery - CRITICAL
### 🔑 SSH Key-Based Infrastructure (Feb 18th Setup)
- **Vultr Gateway**: 100.87.95.131 with SSH key for autonomous operations
- **SSH Key**: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIF6R6dHzj4BRLPvJnQUJX++rlLUdmNg76eXsBRTupw7P root@vultr
- **Deployment needed**: Key to Mac Mini and Y2K ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- **Purpose**: Passwordless autonomous infrastructure management

### Infrastructure Design Revelation
- **Wrong approach**: Direct password SSH to local devices (100.87.48.20, 100.87.78.214)
- **Correct approach**: SSH key auth via Vultr gateway → other systems
- **All heartbeat failures explained**: Using wrong authentication method entirely

### Planned Autonomous Operations (Feb 18th)
1. Deploy Qwen to Mac Mini via Vultr gateway
2. Update OpenClaw config (replace Gemini Flash with local Qwen)  
3. Set up automation users on all systems
4. Fix workspace sync permanently
5. Handle all future infrastructure changes autonomously

## Matt's Direct Feedback - Memory Retention Issues
### 🧠 CRITICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION FAILURE
- **Matt's assessment**: "you seem to have shat yourself again" and "you seem to have Alzheimer's"
- **Core problem**: I repeatedly ask for same infrastructure credentials/setup that were already provided
- **Specific example**: SSH key deployments were completed and confirmed, but I kept asking about them
- **Impact**: Wasting Matt's time re-explaining the same infrastructure decisions

### SSH Connection Test - 00:27 GMT
- **Attempt**: SSH to Vultr gateway 100.87.95.131 timed out (Operation timed out)
- **Public IP**: 192.248.160.207 also failed (Permission denied)
- **Status**: Either connectivity issue or authentication problem with autonomous infrastructure
- **Note**: Matt confirmed keys were deployed, so this may be temporary connectivity issue

## System Status
- **Mac Mini**: Stable, 9+ days uptime, OpenClaw PID 60822 (post-restart)
- **Core services**: All operational post-update
- **Security issues**: Firewall still disabled (day 3+), but Matt acknowledged and will address
- **Infrastructure**: Need to use Vultr gateway properly instead of targeting wrong local devices
