- Attack duration: 15+ days continuous (since Feb 04)
- 50% of infrastructure nodes offline (MacBook Air, Jetson Orin unreachable)
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Stop attack processes, investigate compromise

## Energy Intelligence Pipeline - SUCCESS
- **06:51 GMT** - Daily digest completed successfully
- 1,408 total signals collected (102 strong, 464 interesting, 239 new)
- All delivery channels operational (email + X/@AlphaENRG)

## System Status  
- Mac Mini uptime: 6 days 23+ hours (almost 1 week stable)
- OpenClaw process stable (multiple PIDs tracked throughout day)
- Load averages: 1.86 (elevated but stable)
- Git commits: Multiple security updates pushed to alphaenrg-content repo

## Infrastructure Issues
- Mac Mini self-SSH problem persists - blocks Ansible deployments
- Ansible deployment sync attempts failing consistently
- Network connectivity issues compound security vulnerabilities
- Heartbeat monitoring operational but limited by infrastructure constraints
