- **Result:** No passwords cracked - attack unsuccessful
- **Status:** 50% of infrastructure nodes still offline (MacBook Air, Jetson Orin unreachable)

## Energy Intelligence Pipeline - SUCCESS
- **06:51 GMT** - Daily digest completed successfully
- 1,408 total signals collected (102 strong, 464 interesting, 239 new)

- Load averages: 1.24-2.33 range (fluctuating but within acceptable limits)
- Git commits: Continuous updates pushed (security incidents, heartbeat tracking)

## Infrastructure Issues
- **Mac Mini self-SSH problem persists** - blocks Ansible deployments (17+ failed attempts logged)
- Ansible deployment sync attempts failing consistently throughout day
- Network connectivity issues compound security vulnerabilities
- Heartbeat monitoring operational but limited by infrastructure constraints

## Afternoon/Evening Activities (12:00-18:00 GMT)
- **Continuous heartbeat monitoring** - 4-check rotation cycle maintained
- Memory maintenance: Created and updated daily log files  
- Git operations: Regular commits for state tracking and security updates
- System monitoring: Load spikes detected but system remained stable
- **Critical security posture remains compromised** - no resolution to brute force attack
