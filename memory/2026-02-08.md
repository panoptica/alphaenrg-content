### Alpha Energy Substack Launch
- Matt set up Substack "alphaenergy" connected to Stripe
- Also has Twitter/X account
- Generated art deco logo via ComfyUI SDXL (alpha_energy_logo.png)
- Product copy written - 5 bullet version finalized
- Workflow: I draft content → send to Matt on Telegram → he pastes and publishes
- No direct API access needed for now, copy-paste workflow

### Lens.org
- Matt requested personal access + trial, may take a day

### Tomorrow Morning TODO
- After 6:50am digest runs, draft:
  1. First Substack post from real digest data
  2. X thread (4-5 tweets) with spiciest signals + tickers
- Have both ready by 7:15am for Matt to paste and publish

### Matt Preferences (updated)
- Wants to monetize the intelligence signals
- Human in the loop for all publishing
- Prefers raw/provocative tone (Balaji/Elon energy, not corporate)
- Loose icons, not too AI-looking
- Plans to use Revolut or HL for trading on signals
