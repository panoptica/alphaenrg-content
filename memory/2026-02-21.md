# 2026-02-21 Memory Log

## Early Hours Status - 01:34 GMT
- **Mac Mini uptime**: 8 days, 14:22 hours (stable continuous operation)
- **OpenClaw process**: PID 60822 running normally
- **Load averages**: 1.22 1.45 1.49 (optimal performance levels)

## Carryover Issues from 2026-02-20
### 🔴 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY - DAY 2
- **Firewall remains disabled** - Now **16+ hours** since initial detection (09:02 GMT Feb 20)
- **Port exposure continues** - All services (18789, 3283, 5000, 7000, 22, 88, 5900) exposed without filtering
- **Risk assessment**: MAXIMUM - Unacceptable security posture persists into second day

### Infrastructure Connectivity - No Progress
- **MacBook Air (100.87.78.214)**: Still unreachable
- **Jetson Orin (100.87.171.38)**: Still unreachable  
- **Kali Y2K (100.87.231.197)**: Partial connectivity pattern unchanged (Python discovery, SSH timeout)
- **Ansible deployments**: Blocked by authentication failures across infrastructure

## System Operations
- Multiple heartbeat cycles executed successfully
- Git commits processed: heartbeat-state.json updates, MEMORY.md updates
- Workspace sync checks performed (not applicable - running on Mac Mini)

## Energy Intelligence Pipeline - 06:53 GMT
### ✅ SUCCESSFUL DIGEST COMPLETION
- **Total signals collected**: 1,135
- **New signals stored**: 370
- **Quality breakdown**: 0 critical (≥12), 7 strong (≥7), 125 interesting (≥4)

### Source Performance

- OSINT signals: 500 ✅ (200 Reddit + 200 news + 100 darkweb)
- Lens patents: 243 ✅
- USPTO patents: 100 ✅

## Security Audit - 09:02 GMT
### 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS ESCALATED TO DAY 3
- **Firewall disabled**: Now 48+ hours since detection
- **Infrastructure offline**: 75% of nodes unreachable (MacBook Air, Jetson Orin) since Feb 16
- **VNC exposed**: Port 5900 listening on all interfaces
- **Multiple high-privilege ports exposed**: Various system services unfiltered

### ✅ Positive Security Findings
- **Brute force attack resolved**: Confirmed no Hydra processes on Kali Y2K
- **Core services operational**: OpenClaw Gateway (PID 37717), Ollama responsive
- **System health stable**: Normal CPU/memory/disk usage
- **No unauthorized access attempts** in recent logs

## Daily OpenClaw Intelligence Brief - 08:00 GMT
- Automated research and email delivery initiated
- Market opportunity analysis and trend identification scheduled
- Delivery target: oc@cloudmonkey.io with business angles

## Session Management
- **Heartbeat cycles**: Regular maintenance performed (workspace, git, memory, macmini_ping, ansible_deployment_sync)
- **Git operations**: Multiple commits for heartbeat tracking and memory updates
- **Process monitoring**: OpenClaw PID changes tracked (60822 → 21857 → 37717)
- **Load monitoring**: System performance stable throughout day

## Outstanding Critical Issues
1. **Security vulnerability persists**: Firewall disabled entering day 3
2. **Infrastructure degraded**: 75% nodes offline limiting capabilities
3. **Ansible deployment blocked**: Self-SSH connectivity issues prevent automation
4. **VNC service exposed**: Unauthorized remote access vector active

## Notes
- Pre-compaction memory flush executed at session boundary
- All critical security findings documented and escalated in MEMORY.md
- Energy intelligence pipeline maintaining operational status despite API failures
- System stability excellent despite security exposures
