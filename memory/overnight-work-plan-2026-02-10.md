- Issue templates for different types:
  - Bug reports
  - Incidents
  - Feature requests
  - Empire component failures
- Wiki for knowledge base and playbooks

### 2. PM Agent Design (High)
- Cross-agent coordination architecture

- Communication protocols between agents
- Escalation procedures

### 3. Support Desk System (High)

### 4. Current Infrastructure Issues (Medium)

## Success Criteria
- GitHub repo operational with basic project board

## Context
This is foundational work for scaling to an "Organization of agents" - proper infrastructure before expansion.
