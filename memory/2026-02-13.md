## Energy Digest Success
**Morning 8:27 GMT**: Energy Intelligence Brief ran successfully and delivered:
- 1,013 signals collected (316 ArXiv, 197 SEC, 500 OSINT)
- 220 new signals after deduplication, 11 strong signals (≥7 score)
- ✅ Email sent to oc@cloudmonkey.io
- ✅ Posted to @AlphaENRG (Tweet ID: 2022226591724536145)
- ❌ USPTO and Lens.org APIs failing (400/401 errors)

## SSH Authentication Blocking Infrastructure
**Critical Issue**: SSH to Mac Mini (100.98.31.10) consistently failing with "Permission denied"
- Local SSH key exists: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (SHA256:+/QwKeTc/jR8hsjx6kJq0M2CG571V6Hj3GcjGhjfyno)
- **Root cause**: Public key not in Mac Mini's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- **Impact**: Workspace sync failing, heartbeat checks failing, infrastructure coordination broken

**Matt's Response**: "I've done that already, where are the ssh keys needed?" - suggests he's tried to resolve but issue persists.

## Workspace Infrastructure Setup
- Created `scripts/sync-workspace-to-macmini.sh` with rsync over SSH
- Script designed to sync workspace files while excluding .git, node_modules, logs
- Updates TOOLS.md with sync timestamp automatically
- **Status**: Script created but unusable due to SSH auth issue

## Heartbeat Cycle Issues
Multiple heartbeat cycles today, all following HEARTBEAT.md rotation:
1. Workspace sync → SSH failure
2. Git status → successful commits/pushes
3. Memory maintenance → successful MEMORY.md updates  
4. Mac Mini ping → SSH failure, tried both `macmini` hostname (DNS fail) and IP

**Pattern**: Infrastructure checks failing due to SSH, but local Git/memory tasks succeeding.

## Technical Progress
- Successfully committed 15 files including energy-agent improvements
- Updated MEMORY.md with detailed SSH authentication requirements
- Maintained heartbeat state tracking in memory/heartbeat-state.json
- All Git operations successful despite initial -25308 errors

## Outstanding Issues
1. **CRITICAL**: SSH key authorization to Mac Mini must be resolved for infrastructure sync
2. USPTO/Lens.org API authentication needs investigation
3. Daily workspace sync requirement per HEARTBEAT.md not being met

## Lessons
- Hostname `macmini` requires SSH config or /etc/hosts entry
- SSH public key management is critical for distributed OpenClaw operations
- Heartbeat system working correctly but blocked by authentication layer
- Git operations remain functional despite OAuth keychain warnings
