## DAILY SECURITY AUDIT - COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT

**Audit Time:** 9:00 AM GMT, February 20, 2026
**Auditor:** Automated Security Agent via Cron Job  
**Scope:** Complete infrastructure security assessment

### 🔴 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

1. **FIREWALL DISABLED** - **SEVERITY: CRITICAL**
   - macOS Application Firewall completely disabled (State = 0)
   - All services exposed to network without filtering
   - **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Enable firewall with restrictive rules

### 🟠 HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES

2. **EXCESSIVE PORT EXPOSURE** - **SEVERITY: HIGH**  
   - Ports exposed on all interfaces (*.*): 18789, 3283, 5000, 7000, 22, 88, 5900, 62118, 62485, 65415
   - Port 22 (SSH) exposed despite Netbird SSH disabled
   - Port 5900 (VNC) exposed - potential remote access vector
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Audit and restrict port bindings to localhost where possible

3. **INFRASTRUCTURE CONNECTIVITY DEGRADATION** - **SEVERITY: HIGH**
   - MacBook Air (100.87.78.214): 🔴 UNREACHABLE  
   - Jetson Orin (100.87.171.38): 🔴 UNREACHABLE
   - Only 2/4 Netbird peers connected
   - **IMPACT**: Limited distributed monitoring, reduced redundancy

### 🟡 MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES

4. **NETWORK CONNECTIVITY ISSUES**
   - Self-SSH problem persists (Mac Mini cannot SSH to 100.87.48.20)
   - Blocks automated deployments and self-management
   - Historical IPv4 address warnings in logs

### ✅ POSITIVE SECURITY INDICATORS

5. **THREAT MITIGATION SUCCESS**
   - ✅ Previous brute force attack fully resolved (Feb 19, 18:20 GMT)
   - ✅ No unauthorized processes detected (no ssh/hydra/nmap/metasploit tools)
   - ✅ No suspicious network connections identified
   - ✅ Normal file system activity in sensitive directories
   - ✅ OpenClaw services operational (Gateway PID 7556, uptime 5+ days)

6. **OPERATIONAL STATUS**
   - ✅ Core services: OpenClaw Gateway (18789), Ollama (11434), Energy Agent  
   - ✅ Netbird connectivity: Connected to management/signal, 4/4 relays available
   - ✅ Recent legitimate SSH access from MacBook Air (Feb 15, 16:57-21:07)
   - ✅ System load: 1.50 (manageable), 15GB/16GB memory usage

### 📊 INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS MATRIX

| Node | IP | Status | Last Contact | Security Level |
|------|----|---------|--------------| --------------|
| Mac Mini | 100.87.48.20 | 🟢 ONLINE | Current | ⚠️ **EXPOSED** |
| MacBook Air | 100.87.78.214 | 🔴 OFFLINE | Feb 15 | Unknown |
| Kali Y2K | 100.87.231.197 | 🟡 PARTIAL | Feb 18 | ⚠️ Previous attack source |
| Jetson Orin | 100.87.171.38 | 🔴 OFFLINE | Feb 16 | Unknown |
| Vultr VM | 100.87.95.131 | 🟢 ONLINE | Feb 18 | Unknown |

### 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

**PRIORITY 1 (Critical - Complete within 24h):**
1. Enable macOS Application Firewall immediately
2. Configure restrictive firewall rules for exposed ports
3. Audit VNC (5900) and SSH (22) exposure necessity

**PRIORITY 2 (High - Complete within 48h):**
4. Restore MacBook Air connectivity and assess security posture
5. Investigate and resolve Jetson Orin connectivity issues  
6. Review and harden port bindings (restrict to localhost where possible)

**PRIORITY 3 (Medium - Complete within 7 days):**
7. Resolve Mac Mini self-SSH connectivity for automated deployments
8. Implement automated security monitoring for early threat detection
9. Schedule regular security audits (recommend weekly)

### 🔒 SECURITY POSTURE SUMMARY

- **Overall Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH** (Critical firewall vulnerability + significant port exposure)
- **Attack Surface**: Large (multiple exposed services without firewall protection)  
- **Monitoring Coverage**: Limited (50% infrastructure offline)
- **Incident Response**: ✅ Proven effective (successful brute force termination)

**CONCLUSION**: While threat detection and response capabilities are proven effective, the disabled firewall creates an unacceptable security exposure requiring immediate remediation.

## Afternoon Progress Summary - 16:04 GMT
- **Infrastructure monitoring**: Persistent partial connectivity to Kali Y2K (Python interpreter discovered, SSH timeout continues)
- **Git operations**: Successfully tracking empire-heartbeat monitoring logs + 2,210 line updates committed
- **System stability**: OpenClaw process stable (PID 60822), load averages normalized (1.26 1.42 1.45)
- **Security status**: ⚠️ **UNCHANGED** - Critical firewall vulnerability persists (7+ hours since detection)
- **Connectivity**: MacBook Air & Jetson Orin remain unreachable

## Evening Status - 19:04 GMT
- **System uptime**: 8 days, 8:22 hours (healthy)
- **OpenClaw process**: PID changed 60822 → 6165 (service restart detected)
- **Load averages**: 1.23 1.61 1.65 (stable operational levels)
- **Security posture**: 🔴 **CRITICAL EXPOSURE PERSISTS** (10+ hours since firewall vulnerability detection)
- **Infrastructure**: No improvement in node connectivity (MacBook Air, Jetson Orin still offline)
- **Kali Y2K**: Consistent partial connectivity pattern (Python discovery, SSH auth timeout)
