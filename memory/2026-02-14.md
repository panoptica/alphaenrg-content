## Energy Intelligence Success
**Morning 06:52 GMT**: Energy Digest Agent completed successfully:
- 486 new signals collected (316 ArXiv, 222 SEC, 500 OSINT, 259 Lens.org patents)
- ✅ Digest email sent to oc@cloudmonkey.io
- ✅ Posted to X/Twitter (@AlphaENRG) - Tweet ID: 2022564411324395892
- ❌ Minor issues: Lens.org scholar API 401 errors, Ollama connection failed (non-critical)

## Daily OpenClaw Intelligence Brief Launch
**08:00 GMT**: New automated research service initiated
- Market opportunity research and trend analysis
- Comprehensive brief with OpenClaw business angles
- Delivery target: oc@cloudmonkey.io

## Infrastructure Status - STABLE
**Heartbeat Cycles**: All checks functioning properly throughout day
- ✅ Workspace sync: Successfully syncing to Mac Mini via rsync
- ✅ Git status: Regular commits/pushes working
- ✅ Memory maintenance: MEMORY.md kept current with daily logs
- ✅ Mac Mini ping: Consistent connectivity via IP (100.98.31.10)

**SSH Resolution**: Previous authentication issues resolved
- Direct IP address (100.98.31.10) working reliably
- Hostname 'macmini' still requires SSH config/hosts entry
- Infrastructure sync operating smoothly

## System Health
- Mac Mini M4: 2+ days uptime, load ~1.1-1.4, OpenClaw process 7555 running
- Workspace sync: 11,856 files, ~247MB transferred efficiently
- Heartbeat rotation: Functioning as designed per HEARTBEAT.md

## Lessons
- Direct IP SSH more reliable than hostname resolution
- Energy digest system resilient to individual API failures
- Heartbeat infrastructure monitoring proving effective
- Multiple intelligence brief systems now operational
