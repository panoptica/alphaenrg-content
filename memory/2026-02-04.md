## Energy Intelligence Agent Project - MAJOR PROGRESS

Matt shared a comprehensive spec for an **Energy & Cooling Intelligence Agent** — an automated system to monitor patents, SEC filings, academic papers, and government grants across energy/cooling/quantum tech domains.

**Goal**: Identify investment opportunities 12-18 months before market consensus. Target 2-3 actionable trades/month.

**Spec location**: `specs/energy-intelligence-agent-spec.md`

### What We Built Today

**Collectors (working):**
- ✅ ArXiv collector - 316 papers in test run
- ✅ SEC EDGAR collector - 217 filings in test (no API key needed)
- ⏳ USPTO - updated for new PatentSearch API, needs API key (Matt requested, 1-2 day wait)
- ⏳ Lens.org - backup patent source, needs API key

**Core Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Scoring engine (base score + attention multiplier)
- ✅ SQLite database layer
- ✅ Email delivery via oc@cloudmonkey.io (Gmail SMTP with app password)
- ✅ Daily cron job at 7am London time
- ✅ OpenClaw notification at 7:05am to follow up

**First Full Run Results:**
- 441 total signals (316 ArXiv + 125 SEC)
- 7 strong signals (score ≥7)
- 78 interesting signals (score ≥4)
- 0 critical (≥12) - need more sources for convergence
- Top signal: [9.0] ML model for metal hydrides (hydrogen storage)

### Email Credentials
- Address: oc@cloudmonkey.io
- App password stored in energy-agent/.env (not in git)
- Recipient: oc@cloudmonkey.io

### Hardware Empire - Setup In Progress

Matt offered access to:
1. **M4 Mac Mini** (16GB RAM) - host: 192.168.154.44, user: macmini
   - Ollama installed
   - Llama 3 8B downloading (~4.7GB, was interrupted, restarted)
   - Node.js needs manual GUI install
   
2. **Jetson Nano Orin** - for satellite imagery CV (not yet connected)

3. **Kali Linux box** - for scrapers/social monitoring (not yet connected)

**Planned uses:**
- Mac Mini: Local LLM for synthesis (zero API costs)
- Jetson: Satellite imagery analysis (construction sites, solar farms, data centers)
- Kali: Social media scrapers, news monitoring

### WhatsApp
- Gateway connected as +447788537939
- Tested sending - Matt eventually received messages
- Can use for critical alerts (score ≥12)

### PatentsView API
- Old API deprecated May 2025
- Matt requested new API key: PVS-4987 (1-2 day wait)
- Will enable USPTO patent collection

### Git Commits Today
1. `d48f752` - Initial scaffolding (ArXiv, USPTO, Lens, scoring, database)
2. `1286ee6` - SEC EDGAR collector
3. `2691e58` - Email delivery module
4. `24d3bae` - Daily digest runner and cron scheduling

### Cron Jobs Set
1. **7:00am daily** - System cron runs energy-agent/daily_digest.sh
2. **7:05am daily** - OpenClaw notifies about digest
3. **One-shot** - Check Mac Mini Llama download status

### Mac Mini LLM - WORKING! (18:31 GMT)
- Llama 3 8B downloaded (4.7GB)
- Tested via API: "2+2 = 4" in 2.2 seconds
- API endpoint: http://192.168.154.44:11434
- Notified Matt via WhatsApp

### Kali Box Access
- IP: 192.168.154.193
- SSH: user `oc`, pass `Apple24`
- Full OSINT stack running (Reddit, News, Darkweb scrapers)
- Cron: every 4 hours

### Jetson Orin - PASSWORD CRACKED!
- IP: 192.168.154.124
- SSH: user `deepseek`, pass `jetson_orin`
- Has Ollama installed, Open WebUI on port 8080
- Currently unresponsive - needs recovery/reboot
- Plan: satellite imagery CV work

### Mac Mini OpenClaw Setup
- Node.js installed (v22.2.0)
- Xcode CLI tools downloading (~2.5h, slow connection)
- Once Xcode done, can finish OpenClaw install

### Mac Mini Command Centre - COMPLETE! (22:10 GMT)
- OpenClaw installed and running
- WhatsApp linked (+447788537939)
- Auto-start on boot (LaunchAgent)
- SSH tunnel app created on MacBook
- Workspace synced (memory, energy-agent)
- Gateway token: m4-command-centre-2026

### Overnight Work Progress (22:12-22:25 GMT)
1. ✅ Wire Llama 3 into energy agent for local synthesis
   - Created synthesis/llm.py module
   - Connects to Mac Mini Ollama (192.168.154.44:11434)
   - AI narrative + convergence analysis in daily digest
2. ✅ Expand Kali OSINT (more feeds, crypto angle)
   - Added 11 new feeds (crypto mining, data centers, policy)
   - Twitter scraper created (nitter instances down currently)
3. ✅ Research business/payment options document
   - specs/business-payments-research.md
   - Covers: Coinbase Commerce, BTCPay, UK Ltd, Stripe
4. ✅ Improve scoring engine
   - Enhanced attention scoring with OSINT metrics
   - Reddit score/comments boost multiplier
   - Cross-source convergence detection improved

### Overnight Summary (22:12-22:30 GMT)
All 4 planned items completed:
- LLM synthesis working (tested!)
- OSINT expanded with crypto/energy feeds
- Business/payments doc created
- Scoring engine improved

Files modified:
- energy-agent/synthesis/llm.py (new)
- energy-agent/delivery/email.py (AI narrative added)
- energy-agent/scoring/engine.py (attention improvements)
- specs/business-payments-research.md (new)

Ready for Matt's morning review. Daily digest at 7am will include AI narrative.

### Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Wait for Llama 3 download to complete~~
2. ✅ ~~Test local LLM on Mac Mini~~
3. Wire local LLM into energy agent synthesis
4. Get Kali SSH credentials
5. Get Jetson access
6. Wait for PatentsView API key
7. Add more collectors (DOE grants, news)

### Lessons
- Previous session lost context due to no memory files - ALWAYS write it down
- Matt prefers watching/learning, I do the heavy lifting
- Matt is impatient - show progress, get to the point
