## Energy Intelligence Agent Project

Matt shared a comprehensive spec for an **Energy & Cooling Intelligence Agent** — an automated system to monitor patents, SEC filings, academic papers, and government grants across energy/cooling/quantum tech domains.

**Goal**: Identify investment opportunities 12-18 months before market consensus. Target 2-3 actionable trades/month.

**Spec location**: `specs/energy-intelligence-agent-spec.md`

**Key components**:
- Data collectors (USPTO, SEC, ArXiv, DOE, UKRI, news)
- Scoring engine (0-15 base + attention multiplier)
- Correlation/synthesis using Claude API
- Email delivery with feedback buttons
- User training loop (weeks 1-2), then auto-pilot

**Stack**: Python 3.10+, SQLite, Claude API, cron scheduling

**Timeline**: 4 weeks to auto-pilot, ~40-60 dev hours

**Status**: Starting Week 1 — building USPTO patent collector first.

**Notes**:
- Matt is watching/learning, I'm doing the heavy lifting
- Need SMTP credentials for email delivery (later)
- Previous session lost due to no memory files — don't repeat that mistake
