## Energy Intelligence Success - Morning
**6:51 AM GMT**: Energy Digest Agent completed successfully
- **1,397 total signals collected** (ArXiv: 316, SEC: 222, OSINT: 500, Lens.org: 259, USPTO: 100)
- 100 strong signals (≥7 score), 495 interesting signals (≥4 score)
- 84 new signals stored in database
- ✅ Digest email sent to oc@cloudmonkey.io
- ✅ Posted to X/Twitter (@AlphaENRG) - Tweet ID: 2022926769297183195
- ❌ Lens.org scholarly API still failing (401 errors)
- ❌ Local Ollama connection issues (non-critical)

## Daily OpenClaw Intelligence Brief Launch
**8:00 AM GMT**: New automated research service initiated
- Market opportunity research and trend analysis
- Comprehensive brief with OpenClaw business angles
- Delivery target: oc@cloudmonkey.io

## Infrastructure Updates & Fixes
**Heartbeat System Optimization**: 
- Fixed HEARTBEAT.md to use direct IP (100.98.31.10) instead of hostname for Mac Mini ping
- Resolved timestamp management issues in heartbeat-state.json (corrected future timestamps)
- All heartbeat checks cycling properly: workspace sync, git status, memory maintenance, Mac Mini ping

**System Health**:
- Mac Mini M4: 3+ days uptime, load ~1.1, OpenClaw process 7555 running stable
- Multiple successful workspace syncs (12,935 files, ~1.3MB transferred)
- Git operations functional (commits/pushes working despite credential caching warnings)
- SSH connectivity via Tailscale IP reliable

## Lessons Learned
- Direct IP addressing (100.98.31.10) more reliable than hostname resolution for Mac Mini
- Heartbeat timestamp management requires careful epoch time calculations
- Energy digest system resilient to individual API failures
- Pre-compaction memory flush working as designed for session continuity
