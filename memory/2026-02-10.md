# 2026-02-10 - Empire Connectivity Fix + Missing Context

## Critical Error Fixed (23:20 GMT)
**Problem**: HEARTBEAT.md was checking LAN connectivity (192.168.154.44) instead of Tailscale VPN

**Matt's Feedback**: "I already asked you to sort this and you said you had. What happens? Can you make sure the Mac has keepalives? Why are you connecting over local landline? This should be using the tail VPN and never lan."

## Status Check Results
✅ **Mac Mini M4 (Tailscale 100.98.31.10)**: ONLINE
- Ollama working: 5 models available (llama3.1:8b-32k, llama3.1:8b, deepseek-r1:8b, qwen2.5:7b, llama3:8b)
- API endpoint: http://100.98.31.10:11434

⚠️ **ComfyUI**: OFFLINE (port 8188 not responding)

## Fixes Applied
1. **HEARTBEAT.md updated**: Now checks Tailscale connectivity, not LAN
2. **MEMORY.md updated**: Documented Tailscale-first policy
3. **Lesson documented**: Always use VPN addresses for empire monitoring

## Lessons
- **Regression prevention**: Need to maintain VPN-first connectivity
- **Documentation drift**: Must keep monitoring scripts in sync with infrastructure changes
- **Matt's patience**: Valid frustration - this was a step backward

## CRITICAL: Missing Context Issue (23:37 GMT)
**Problem**: I lost conversation context from today where Matt provided:
- Gmail app password: `qfez dioy gjlm oeoo` (tested, working)
- USPTO API key: `N4vIXj2M.tZo5TVasHzojYgbHbEq4b2k4RlveyJW1` (working)

Both are in `energy-agent/.env` but I failed to document this in memory files.

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Energy digest emails should be working (7am daily)
- ✅ USPTO collector should be working 
- ❌ Kanban board showed false blocked status

**Lesson**: ALWAYS write memory files immediately after receiving credentials/config changes.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Investigate ComfyUI offline status
- [ ] Verify all empire monitoring uses Tailscale addresses only
- [ ] Test USPTO collector is actually working with new key
- [ ] Confirm 7am energy digests are arriving
